### Code Highlighting

Using highlight.js to highlight code syntax in blocks.

To upgrade this go to the [CDN release repo](https://github.com/highlightjs/cdn-release) and download
the new version of `highlight.min.js` and all minified languages and styles being used.  Then remove
extra padding from the styles so that it doesn't conflict with the padding in Tailwind.
