jobs:

    description:
      At MobileCause, I worked with a small engineering team to build
      a mobile fundraising platform that helped nonprofit organizations
      increase donations &amp; donor engagement.
    accomplishments:
      - Led upgrade of the Rails stack from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4. This included upgrading the test
        framework (RSpec 2.x to 3.x) &amp; organizing the upgrade changes so that they could be made
        incrementally to avoid merging and regression issues that accompany long running branches.
      - Diagnosed &amp; solved performance issues that allowed the application to properly handle increased
        load during heavy traffic spikes.  The fixes included improving performance in every part of the stack,
        from view rendering, to workers, to database query optimization.
      - Produced a Rails application that empowered nonprofits to run
        fundraising campaigns with configurable donation forms, fundraising
        reports, SMS messaging, &amp; donor management.
      - Upgraded the UI in the Rails application from custom CSS to
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
        which increased the maintainability of the site as well as reduced time
        &amp; effort needed to build new pages.
      - Implemented a RabbitMQ based message queue to handle certain jobs
        asynchronously (sending emails, processing file uploads) to improve
        the performance of the system.
      - Wrote &amp; open-sourced an API integration wrapper for the
        <a href="http://www.cardconnect.com/" target="_blank">CardConnect</a>
        API in Ruby. See Projects section below for more details.
