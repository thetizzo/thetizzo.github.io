    description:
      At MobileCause, I worked with a team to build a fundraising platform that helps nonprofit organizations
      increase donations &amp; donor engagement. I was one of the senior members of this team &amp; I spent time
      working on all parts of the stack which included Rails, MySQL, &amp; RabbitMQ.
    accomplishments:
      - Led the effort to upgrade the Rails stack from Rails 3.2 to Rails 4. This included upgrading the test
        framework (RSpec 2.x to 3.x) &amp; organizing the upgrade changes so that they could be made
        incrementally to avoid merging &amp; regression issues that accompany long running branches.
      - Transitioned the CI system from a single node Jenkins CI to Travis CI. This improved build
        speed &amp; visibility for the team because we were able to introduce Pull Request builds &amp;
        concurrent builds into our workflow.
      - Diagnosed &amp; solved performance issues that allowed the application to properly handle increased
        load during periods of heavy traffic. This included improving performance in every part of the stack,
        from view rendering, to offloading tasks to workers, to database query optimization.
      - Upgraded the UI in the Rails application from custom CSS to
        <a href="http://getbootstrap.com/" target="_blank">Bootstrap</a>
        which increased the maintainability of the site as well as reduced time
        &amp; effort needed to build new pages.
      - Implemented a RabbitMQ based message queue to handle certain jobs
        asynchronously (sending emails, processing file uploads) to improve
        the performance of the system.
      - Wrote &amp; open-sourced an API integration wrapper for the
        <a href="http://www.cardconnect.com/" target="_blank">CardConnect</a>
        API in Ruby. See Projects section below for more details.
